## How to deploy a code from one environment (dev) to another (preprod)?

Deploying PySpark code from one environment to another, such as from development (dev) to pre-production (pre-prod), involves a few key steps to ensure the transition is smooth and efficient. Here are a few methods to achieve this, with an emphasis on simplicity and effectiveness:

### Method 1: Version Control System (VCS)

Using a Version Control System like Git is a standard approach to manage and deploy code across different environments.

1. **Commit Changes**: Commit your final, tested PySpark code to your VCS in the dev branch.
2. **Merge to Main/Master**: Merge your dev branch to the main/master branch after thorough testing and review.
3. **Pull in Pre-Prod**: Switch to the pre-prod environment and pull the latest changes from the main/master branch.

### Method 2: Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Pipeline

Automate the deployment using CI/CD tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or GitHub Actions.

1. **Setup Pipeline**: Configure a pipeline that triggers on code changes in your VCS.
2. **Test Stage**: Include a stage in your pipeline to run tests on your PySpark code.
3. **Deploy Stage**: If tests pass, automatically deploy the code to the pre-prod environment using scripts or deployment tools.

### Method 3: Containerization

Use Docker to containerize your PySpark application, ensuring consistency across environments.

1. **Dockerize Application**: Create a `Dockerfile` for your PySpark application, specifying dependencies and entry points.
2. **Build Image**: Build the Docker image in the dev environment after testing.
3. **Push Image to Registry**: Push the Docker image to a container registry like Docker Hub or a private registry.
4. **Pull & Run in Pre-Prod**: Pull the Docker image in the pre-prod environment and run it.

### Method 4: Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Leverage IaC tools like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation to manage infrastructure changes along with your code deployment.

1. **Define Infrastructure**: Define your pre-prod environment infrastructure as code, including compute resources for PySpark.
2. **Apply Changes**: Apply infrastructure changes in the pre-prod environment to match the dev environment setup.
3. **Deploy Code**: Use scripts or CI/CD pipelines to deploy your PySpark code onto the newly configured infrastructure.

### Code-Based Solution Example

For CI/CD pipeline setup (Method 2), here's a simplified example using GitHub Actions:

```yaml
name: PySpark Deployment Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Run PySpark Tests
      run: pytest # Assuming you have tests set up

  deploy:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Deploy to Pre-Prod
      run: |
        # Your deployment script here, e.g., SSH into pre-prod and pull changes
        ssh -i your_key.pem your_user@pre-prod-server "cd your_project_directory && git pull"

```

This YAML file defines a GitHub Actions workflow that triggers on pushes to the main branch, runs tests, and if the tests pass, deploys the code to a pre-prod environment.

Remember, the choice of method depends on your project's specific needs, existing infrastructure, and team practices. Each method aims to ensure code quality, ease of deployment, and consistency across environments.
